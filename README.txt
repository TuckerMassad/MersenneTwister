Pseudorandom Number Generator, Mersenne Twister, implemented in python alongside a brute force password cracker.

To run everything:

crack.py - Simply run the file and insert any test files into the same directory and type "test_file_you're_using.txt" into the console upon request
mersenne.py - To check out this functionality, please use demo.py
demo.py - Simply run the file and choose either (1,2,3) for the corresponding functionality

Thanks!

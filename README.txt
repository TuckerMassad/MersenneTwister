Project 2 ReadME Massad:

Everything is complete and running besides the eavesdrop() functionality in mersenne.py -
I spent a lot of time working on figuring out the best way to attack a secret key by searching words in the dictionary,
but it ended up not getting completed to the degree i'd like. I feel very satisfactory about my other functionalities though!

To run everything:

crack.py - Simply run the file and insert any test files into the same directory and type "test_file_you're_using.txt" into the console upon request
mersenne.py - To check out this functionality, please use demo.py
demo.py - Simply run the file and choose either (1,2,3) for the corresponding functionality. As stated before, 3 doesn't completely work (but I gave it a good shot!)

Thanks!
